| **[MusicMaker](https://github.com/Akjo03/MusicMaker)**  | Create .musicxml files to create any kind of music with an easy to use command-line tool. This project is made in Java. | Currently in early development and restricted until 22.03.2021. |
| **Desert Run Remake** | A small 2D platformer that plays in a desert land, which was first made by me and a friend in [GameMaker Studio 2](https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker) and now get's a remastered (solely by me probably). The goal of the game is to defeat the boss at the end of Level 1. Also my first real unity project. May get expanded further after level 1 is completed. Made in [Unity](https://unity.com/de) with C#. (Currently not on my GitHub) | Basic Gameplay Mechanics are getting implemented. I want to do this project right so development is going to be rather slow. |
